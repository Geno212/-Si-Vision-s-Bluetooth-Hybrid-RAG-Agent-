  "answer": "**Missing information** [#1]\n\n- Exact names of the controller Clock‑Domain‑Crossing (CDC) blocks – the provided excerpts do not list any CDC block names. [#4]\n- The precise spec phrase for BEACON randomization from The Bluetooth Beacon Primer – the excerpts do not contain the wording. [#2]\n\n**Likely sources to obtain the missing details** [#1]\n\n- Full *Architecture and Design of a BLE Controller* PDF (look for sections titled “Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)”, “CDC blocks”, or “CDC design”). [#4]\n- Full *Bluetooth Beacon Primer* PDF (search for “randomization”, “beacon randomization”, or the section on “ADVERTISING WORKS” that discusses random offsets). [#2]",
