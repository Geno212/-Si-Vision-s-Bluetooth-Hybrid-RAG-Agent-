# Agent Enhancement Checklist (Advanced)

## Orchestrator
- [x] Dynamic iteration limit: allow max feedback iterations to be set via UI input

## Validation Agent
- [x] Citation strictness: directly prompt SynthesisAgent to add missing citations
- [x] Validation web search: another validation agent (validation agent web) trigger Serper web search always and make it validate current answer after the 1st validation as an additional validation layer

## Logging
- [x] Log agent execution times, error rates, and context block usage

## User Feedback Loop
- [ ] Allow end-users to provide feedback on answers; log feedback in a .txt file(will not implement now)

---
Mark each task as done after implementation.
