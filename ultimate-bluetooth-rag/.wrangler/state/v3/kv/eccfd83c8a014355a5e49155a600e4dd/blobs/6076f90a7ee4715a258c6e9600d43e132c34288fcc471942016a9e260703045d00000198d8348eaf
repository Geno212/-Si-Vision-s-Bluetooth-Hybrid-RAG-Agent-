[#W3]  \n  - Asynchronous FIFO buffers are recommended for synchronizing continuously changing vector data between two asynchronous clock domains. [#W2]  \n  - Gray coding can be used to reduce metastability when transferring multi‑bit counters or addresses. [#W3]  \n\n- Because the context does not provide details on the BLE controller’s clock‑domain strategy, it is unclear which of these techniques (or others) are actually employed in that design.  \n\n- If a beacon scanner were to handle asynchronous advertising reception, it could adopt similar CDC strategies:  \n  - Use a dual‑flop synchronizer to safely sample the incoming advertising packet flag or timestamp from the radio clock domain into the processor clock domain.  \n  - Employ an asynchronous FIFO to buffer the variable‑length advertising payloads received at the radio clock rate before processing them at the host clock rate.  \n  - Apply Gray coding when transferring multi‑bit counters (e.g., packet sequence numbers) between domains to minimize metastability.  \n\n  These suggestions are based on the general CDC techniques described in the sources, not on any BLE‑specific information.","createdAt":"2025-08-23T18:32:59.801Z"}],"lastCitations":[]}
