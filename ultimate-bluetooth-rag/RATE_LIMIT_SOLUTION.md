# Rate Limiting & Processing Solution

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues from Logs

1. **Batch embedding response parsing failed** - BGE-Large returns different format
2. **"Too many subrequests" errors** - Hit Cloudflare Workers AI rate limits  
3. **5-minute timeout** - Process too slow with individual fallbacks

## âœ… Immediate Solutions Applied

### 1. Response Format Debugging
- Added detailed logging to see BGE-Large response structure
- Will identify correct parsing method

### 2. Rate Limit Management
- **Reduced batch size**: 25 â†’ 10 chunks per batch
- **Increased delays**: 2s â†’ 10s between batches
- **Individual processing delay**: 1.2s â†’ 5s per request

### 3. Timeout Considerations
- 372 chunks Ã— 10 chunks/batch = ~37 batches
- 37 batches Ã— 10s delay = ~6 minutes (will hit timeout)

## ðŸŽ¯ Better Long-term Solutions

### Option A: Process in Background (Recommended)
```bash
# Split into smaller jobs that won't timeout
# Process 50 chunks at a time, save progress
```

### Option B: Use Public Ingest Endpoint
The public ingest endpoint might have different rate limits:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://bt-rag.hybridrag.workers.dev/ingest-public" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"bluetooth-spec","text":"...","title":"Core v6.1"}'
```

### Option C: Use Different Approach
- Upload smaller sections (50-100 pages at a time)
- Process during off-peak hours
- Use the script-based ingestion instead of R2 workflow

## ðŸš€ Quick Test Commands

### Deploy the fixes:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Test with smaller document first:
```bash
# Create a smaller test file (first 50 pages)
# Upload that to test the fixes work
```

### Monitor the improved response parsing:
```bash
wrangler tail --format=pretty | grep "EMBEDDING"
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results After Fix

With the debugging logs, you should see:
```
[EMBEDDING] Raw response keys: ['data', 'result', ...]
[EMBEDDING] Response preview: {"data": [[0.1, 0.2, ...]], ...}
[EMBEDDING] Using res.data format, found 10 vectors
```

This will identify the correct response format and fix the batch processing issue.

## âš¡ Immediate Action Plan

1. **Deploy the fixes** 
2. **Try processing again** - should show better response parsing
3. **If still rate limited** - try the public ingest endpoint
4. **If timeout persists** - split document into smaller chunks

The response format debugging will solve the main issue!
